# landing-page

In this lesson, I was given some designs and tasked with building a landing page based on them to test my ability to place the content correctly. I faced a few challenges with alignment at first, but after a bit of research, I was able to resolve them. I really enjoyed the process of building something, and Iâ€™m excited to start learning JavaScript next!
